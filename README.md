# Quantity Measurement App

## Overview

The Quantity Measurement App is a Java-based application designed to compare different physical quantities such as length and weight across various units.

The application is developed incrementally using clearly defined use cases. Each use case introduces a specific level of functionality, ensuring controlled scope, maintainability, and clean architecture.

The project emphasizes:
- Object-Oriented Design principles
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Incremental development
- Clean code practices
- Proper unit testing

---  

## Objective

The primary goal of this application is to:

- Compare quantities across different units
- Support unit conversion
- Maintain correctness using test-driven development
- Gradually evolve toward supporting quantity arithmetic
- Demonstrate scalable design using enums and generic modeling

---

## Development Approach

This project follows a Use Case Driven Development approach.

Each use case:
- Has a clearly defined scope
- Introduces a small, testable feature
- Avoids unnecessary complexity
- Builds upon the previous implementation

## UC11: Volume Measurement (Litre, Millilitre, Gallon)

## Description
Adds a third measurement category — volume — by creating a `VolumeUnit` enum implementing `IMeasurable`. No changes to `Quantity<U>`, `QuantityMeasurementApp`, or existing tests required. Proves the UC10 architecture scales linearly.

## Conversion Factors (base: LITRE)
| Unit | Factor |
|------|--------|
| LITRE | 1.0 |
| MILLILITRE | 0.001 |
| GALLON | 3.78541 |

## Key Concepts
- Only a new enum needed to add a full measurement category
- Cross-category safety: `1.0 LITRE ≠ 1.0 KILOGRAM` and `1.0 LITRE ≠ 1.0 FOOT`
- All generic `Quantity<U>` operations work automatically

# Quantity Measurement App

## Overview

The Quantity Measurement App is a Java-based application designed to compare different physical quantities such as length and weight across various units.

The application is developed incrementally using clearly defined use cases. Each use case introduces a specific level of functionality, ensuring controlled scope, maintainability, and clean architecture.

The project emphasizes:
- Object-Oriented Design principles
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Incremental development
- Clean code practices
- Proper unit testing

---  

## Objective

The primary goal of this application is to:

- Compare quantities across different units
- Support unit conversion
- Maintain correctness using test-driven development
- Gradually evolve toward supporting quantity arithmetic
- Demonstrate scalable design using enums and generic modeling

---

## Development Approach

This project follows a Use Case Driven Development approach.

Each use case:
- Has a clearly defined scope
- Introduces a small, testable feature
- Avoids unnecessary complexity
- Builds upon the previous implementation

## UC12: Subtraction and Division Operations

## Description
Extends `Quantity<U>` with subtraction (returns `Quantity<U>`) and division (returns dimensionless `double`). Both operations support cross-unit arithmetic within the same category and maintain immutability.

## Operations
| Method | Returns | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `subtract(other)` | `Quantity<U>` | Result in first operand's unit |
| `subtract(other, targetUnit)` | `Quantity<U>` | Result in explicit unit |
| `divide(other)` | `double` | Dimensionless ratio |

## Key Concepts
- Subtraction is **non-commutative**: `A - B ≠ B - A`
- Division is **non-commutative**: `A ÷ B ≠ B ÷ A`
- Division by zero throws `ArithmeticException`
- Cross-category operations throw `IllegalArgumentException`

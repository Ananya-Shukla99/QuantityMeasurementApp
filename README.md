# Quantity Measurement App

## Overview

The Quantity Measurement App is a Java-based application designed to compare different physical quantities such as length and weight across various units.

The application is developed incrementally using clearly defined use cases. Each use case introduces a specific level of functionality, ensuring controlled scope, maintainability, and clean architecture.

The project emphasizes:
- Object-Oriented Design principles
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Incremental development
- Clean code practices
- Proper unit testing

---  

## Objective

The primary goal of this application is to:

- Compare quantities across different units
- Support unit conversion
- Maintain correctness using test-driven development
- Gradually evolve toward supporting quantity arithmetic
- Demonstrate scalable design using enums and generic modeling

---

## Development Approach

This project follows a Use Case Driven Development approach.

Each use case:
- Has a clearly defined scope
- Introduces a small, testable feature
- Avoids unnecessary complexity
- Builds upon the previous implementation

## UC10: Generic Quantity Class with IMeasurable Interface

## Description
Refactors `QuantityLength` and `QuantityWeight` into a single generic `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>` class. Eliminates code duplication across categories using a common interface. All UC1–UC9 functionality preserved.

## Architecture
| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| `IMeasurable` | Defines unit conversion contract |
| `LengthUnit` / `WeightUnit` | Implement `IMeasurable` with conversion factors |
| `Quantity<U>` | Handles equality, conversion, addition for any unit |
| `QuantityMeasurementApp` | Generic demonstration only |

## Key Concepts
- Bounded type parameter `<U extends IMeasurable>` for compile-time type safety
- Cross-category prevention via `unit.getClass()` comparison
- `equals()`, `convertTo()`, `add()` implemented once — reused for all categories
- Adding new categories requires ONLY a new enum implementing `IMeasurable`
